Create a testing framework from scratch on the base of Playwright for the website [https://www.saucedemo.com/](https://www.saucedemo.com/)

1. Create and write a 10 automation test cases that would verify the basic functionality all over the website
2. Use some different approach for the structure for eg Page Factory
3. Use Facade design pattern in your solution. [Link](https://github.com/DimaSmaha/design-patterns-examples/tree/main/v2/facade)
4. Use any other design pattern for your solution, for eg DTO, PageObjectComponents or any other pattern  [https://github.com/DimaSmaha/design-patterns-examples/tree/main/v2](https://github.com/DimaSmaha/design-patterns-examples/tree/main/v2)
5. Generate a random data with faker.js to make sure that your test data will be dynamic
6. Use environment variables to store credentials and sensitive data
7. Create 2 configs to be able to run the tests on different browsers & different screen sizes.
8. Use 2 projects in one of the configs
9. Upload a solution to Github & Integrate your solution with Github Actions to run tests automatically on each push. Optimize your tests to run them in parallel.
